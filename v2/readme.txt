Design principles:
A standardised compute module (CM4) will provide the computer and OS capability (incl bluetooth and wifi). 
This will dock with our custom PCB which will offer power management, a built-in SIM7600 chip for calls, SMS and 4G internet, a sound amp, headphone jack and USB camera.
We hope to stack all of this together between 12 - 15mm total height.

We have raised enough to hire a professional PCB designer on UpWork to design v1 of our new PCB. He is busy. 
We are working on the outstanding issues listed in our wiki document (find link in Telegram group).

After much debate we took the SIM7600 modem chip off the PCB board so that it becomes more modular and the PCB is cheaper to produce and iterate on. The SIM7600 will now plug in via an M2 connector.
I will start uploading the EasyEDA files into the V2 folder as they become available.
Next step is to order a PCB and test it.
