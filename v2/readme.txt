Design principles:
A standardised compute module (CM4) will provide the computer and OS capability (incl bluetooth and wifi). 
This will dock with our custom PCB which will offer power management, a built-in SIM7600 chip for calls, SMS and 4G internet, a sound amp, headphone jack and USB camera.
We hope to stack all of this together between 12 - 15mm total height.
